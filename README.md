# local_databricks
```local_databricks``` is a Python library that provides a set of functions for handling running notebooks both locally and in Databricks using the same commands. It aims to simplify the development process by allowing developers to use a consistent interface, regardless of where the notebook is running.

## Instalation
To install local_databricks, run the following command:

```TODO```


## Usage
To use local_databricks, you first need to authenticate with Databricks. You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

```TODO```

You can then import the local_databricks module and use its functions to interact with Databricks:


```
# TODO
import local_databricks

# Run a notebook locally
local_databricks.run_notebook_locally('/path/to/notebook.ipynb')

# Run a notebook on Databricks
local_databricks.run_notebook_on_databricks('/path/to/notebook.ipynb')
```
